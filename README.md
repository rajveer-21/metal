# METAL
A custom made interpreter in Java inspired by Robert Nystorm and The Dragon Book.

# GUI of the interpreter

Has the capability of taking either command line inputs through String args[] or through direct terminal inputs. The terminal is supported by a line by line input with a rigorous error handler which has the property of being able to define in which line the error just happened (will be expanded to be more inclusive soon! Stay tuned.). 

# LEXER

Defined inside the Scanner class.
Has the capability of using a large number of keywords including logical, operational and specified. Can also implement a large number of operators, standard to most other High Level Languages. Supports variables such as strings, number and alphanumeric combinations as well by using the **var** keyword.
